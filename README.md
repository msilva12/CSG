# Class Schedule Generator

Filter time conflicting combinations.

Create all combinational matrices.

Sort the classes found in a two dimensional array.

Export all non-conflicting combinations to excel in an agent view.

The Purpose of this project is to aid students with class selection at my university (University of Massachusetts Dartmouth).

Students will be able to select up to eight courses, and from that information the matlab script will search for those courses
from the course listing and create an array of possible schedules.

Create a search routine that will return all the classes given its three letter subject code (e.g. BIO) and its three numbers
level (e.g. 101).
  
 ####So far I have been able to:
 Read the course listing file and save it to a matlab .mat file.
